# Pacman

This example demonstrates the well-known game Pacman, which was developed in C# using the WinForms API. The game screen is a maze, the corridors of 
which are filled with dots. The player's task is to control the Pacman, eat all the dots in the maze, avoiding the ghosts that are chasing the hero. 
At the beginning of the level, the ghosts are located in a rectangular room in the middle of the level that is inaccessible to Pacman, from which they 
are eventually released. If the ghost touches the Pacman, his life is lost, the ghosts and the Pacman return to their original position, but the progress 
of the collected points is saved. If the Pacman has no extra lives left when facing the ghost, the game ends. On the sides of the maze there are two 
entrances to one tunnel, when entering which Pacman and the ghosts exit from the other side of the maze.
